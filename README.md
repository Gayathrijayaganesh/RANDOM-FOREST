# RANDOM-FOREST

 The Random forest or Random Decision Forest is a supervised Machine learning algorithm used for classification, regression, and other tasks using decision trees.
The Random forest classifier creates a set of decision trees from a randomly selected subset of the training set. It is basically a set of decision trees (DT) from a randomly selected subset of the training set and then It collects the votes from different decision trees to decide the final prediction.
